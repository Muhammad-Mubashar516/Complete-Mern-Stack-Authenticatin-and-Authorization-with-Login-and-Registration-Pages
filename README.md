MERN Stack Authentication and Authorization
This repository contains a complete MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application featuring user authentication and authorization with login and registration pages. The application demonstrates best practices for implementing secure user authentication and role-based authorization.

Features
User Registration: Allows new users to create an account by providing a name, email, and password.
User Login: Authenticates existing users and provides them with a JWT token.
Role-Based Authorization: Grants access to certain parts of the application based on user roles (e.g., admin).
Protected Routes: Ensures that only authenticated users can access certain routes.
Token-Based Authentication: Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication.
Form Validation: Validates user inputs on both client-side and server-side.
Password Hashing: Secures user passwords using bcrypt hashing.
Technologies Used
Frontend:

React
Axios
React Router
Backend:

Node.js
Express
MongoDB (Mongoose for ODM)
bcrypt for password hashing
jsonwebtoken for token generation and verification
cookie-parser for handling cookies
